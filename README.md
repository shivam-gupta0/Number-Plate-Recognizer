# Number-Plate-Recognizer
ANPR performed in specific conditions with predictable license plate types can use basic image processing techniques.
Advanced ANPR systems utilize object detectors i.e., Faster R-CNN, SSDs, LSTM, and YOLO, to localize license plates in images.

# Steps
Detect and localize a license plate in an input image.
Extract the characters from the license plate
Apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to recognize the characters
